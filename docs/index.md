## :octicons-info-16: About NSClient++

NSClient is an [:material-alert-box-outline: agent](nsclient.md) designed originally to work with Nagios but has
since evolved into a fully fledged monitoring agent which can be used with numerous monitoring tools. If you want more
in-depth information see the [:material-head-question: documentation](https://docs.nsclient.org/)</a>
instead.

## :material-rocket-launch: Getting started

I know NSClient++ can seem daunting. But is really isn't, especially not now with all

But it is "open-ended" so before you start be sure to read through
the [:fontawesome-solid-graduation-cap: tutorial](https://docs.nsclient.org/tutorial/index.html) for your
scenario, and we are sure you will be on a journey towards #MonitoringLove.
