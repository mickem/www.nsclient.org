# Agent Integration Reference (post-enrollment)

The operating contract for an agent that is **already enrolled**: how it keeps its
configuration in sync, reports state, and maintains its certificate.
For enrollment itself and a suggested agent architecture, see
[agent-implementation.md](agent-implementation.md).

Everything below happens over **mTLS** against the `mtls_url` received at enrollment,
authenticated by the client certificate — no tokens, no identity in request bodies. The
server resolves `(tenant_id, host_id)` from the certificate on every request.

## The sync loop at a glance

```
loop:
  GET /agent/v1/desired-state?current_hash=<h>
    304 → sleep next_poll_in_seconds (+ jitter), continue
    200 → download missing bundles → verify → apply → render INI → restart NSClient
          POST /agent/v1/state-report { applied_state_hash, reported_tags, errors,
                                        local_config_present }
  POST /agent/v1/renew   (when cert has < 14 days left)
```

The server never pushes. Every change an operator makes (tags, groups, assignments,
overrides, new bundle versions) reaches the agent through the next poll.

## 1. Config sync

### 1.1 Poll

```
GET {mtls_url}/agent/v1/desired-state?current_hash=<last successfully applied hash>
```

Omit `current_hash` only when the agent has never applied anything (or lost its state).

**`304 Not Modified`** — nothing to do. Body: `{"next_poll_in_seconds": N}`. Sleep `N`
seconds plus a small jitter (±10%) and poll again. `N` comes from the tenant's tier —
never hardcode a poll interval.

**`200 OK`** — new desired state:

```json
{
  "state_hash": "3f2a…",
  "next_poll_in_seconds": 30,
  "merged_config_json": {},
  "bundles": [
    { "id": "01J…", "name": "sql-monitoring", "version": "2.1.0",
      "sha256": "<hex>", "signature": "<base64>",
      "url": "/agent/v1/bundles/01J…", "priority": 100, "format": "plain" }
  ]
}
```

- `bundles` is ordered by **ascending priority** — apply in exactly this order so the
  agent's merge matches the server's layering.
- `merged_config_json` is currently always `{}`: all real configuration lives inside
  bundle contents, and host overrides are folded into `state_hash` server-side. Treat the
  field as a forward-compatibility slot — merge it like a bundle patch if it is ever
  non-empty.
- `state_hash` covers the bundle set (ids, digests, priorities) and the merged config.
  Persist it only after a fully successful apply.

**`429 Too Many Requests`** — the agent polled faster than the tier's floor or exceeded
its per-host request budget. Honor the `Retry-After` header, then resume the normal
cadence. A 429 is always a pacing bug or a restart artifact, never fatal.

### 1.2 Download and verify bundles

For each bundle not already in the local cache (key by `id` + `sha256`):

```
GET {mtls_url}/agent/v1/bundles/{id}
```

Then, in order, before touching the filesystem:

1. **Integrity** — SHA-256 of the downloaded bytes must equal `sha256`.
2. **Authenticity** — `signature` is a base64 Ed25519 signature over the bundle's
   **descriptor**: a version prefix followed by the response's `tenant_id` and this
   bundle's `id`, `name`, `version`, `format` and `sha256`, NUL-separated. Verified
   with the `bundle_signing_pub_pem` received at enrollment/renewal. Signing the
   digest alone would only say "this tenant's server saw these bytes once"; the
   descriptor says which bundle they are, so an old signed blob cannot be
   re-advertised under a new name. Exact bytes:
   [agent-implementation.md §4](agent-implementation.md#4-bundle-download-and-verification).

A `403` means the bundle is not in this host's effective set (the server recomputes
membership on every download) — treat it as "desired state changed under me": abandon
this apply cycle and re-poll. A verification failure means the bundle must not be
applied; record it in `errors` on the state report and keep running the previous config.

### 1.2.1 Encrypted bundles (`format: "enc-v1"`)

Bundles can be encrypted **client-side** by the operator before upload, with a key the
server never holds. The server stores, signs, and serves the ciphertext opaquely — it can
neither read such a bundle nor fabricate one that agents will accept, because AES-GCM
authentication fails for anyone without the key. This is the mechanism that keeps a
compromised control plane from reaching into agents through bundle content.

Blob layout (`fleet_core::encbundle` and `web/src/crypto.ts` are the reference
implementations — byte-identical constructions):

```
"NSEB1" (5 bytes) || key fingerprint (8) || nonce (12) || AES-256-GCM ciphertext + tag
```

- **Key**: 32 random bytes, base64 in configuration. Provisioned to the agent
  out-of-band via its local config (alongside the enrollment token — never from the
  server). Configure it as a *list*, newest first; multiple entries exist only
  mid-rotation.
- **Fingerprint**: first 8 bytes of SHA-256 over the raw key. Match it against your
  configured keys to pick the right one — or to report "no key for this bundle" cleanly.
- **AAD**: `name || 0x00 || version` (UTF-8), taken from the poll response. Decryption
  therefore *authenticates the bundle's identity*: a server substituting one
  validly-encrypted bundle for another fails the tag check.

Agent procedure, after the §1.2 integrity + signature checks pass (both run over the
ciphertext, unchanged):

1. Detect by the **magic bytes**, not the `format` field — the magic is inside the
   signed/authenticated blob; the field is advisory.
2. Look up the key by fingerprint; decrypt with the poll-advertised `name`/`version` as
   AAD. Any failure → treat exactly like a signature failure: do not apply, report in
   `errors`, keep the previous config.
3. The plaintext is an ordinary bundle zip — continue with §1.3.

Two hardening options an agent should offer:

- **`require_encrypted_bundles`** (local config, default off): refuse any bundle that is
  not an authenticated NSEB1 envelope. With this set, bundle content — including scripts
  the agent executes — can only originate from a key holder, so a compromised server
  cannot push code to the host. Without it, encryption protects confidentiality only.
  (The server-computed `merged_config_json` remains a server-controlled input even then;
  it is currently always `{}`, and an agent in this posture should ignore it.)
- **Downgrade refusal**: a compromised server can replay an *older* validly-encrypted
  version of a bundle. Agents that remember the last-applied version per bundle name and
  refuse downgrades close this; treat a forced rollback (a legitimate operation) as the
  documented exception — it arrives as a *new* assignment, so an explicit
  operator-driven downgrade still works by uploading a fresh version.

Key loss is unrecoverable by design — there is no server-side escrow. Losing every copy
of the key orphans the bundles encrypted under it; they must be re-uploaded.

### 1.3 Apply

A bundle zip contains:

| entry | meaning |
|---|---|
| `bundle.toml` | manifest: name, version, target_os, schema version, declared config keys, script paths |
| `config.json` | a JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396) fragment |
| `scripts/*` | files to drop on the host at the manifest-declared paths |

Apply procedure (all-or-nothing):

1. Start from `{}` and apply each bundle's `config.json` as a **JSON Merge Patch** in
   the delivered (priority) order: objects deep-merge, scalars and arrays replace
   wholesale, `null` deletes a key.
2. Stage script files from each bundle; higher-priority bundles win path collisions.
3. **Render the merged JSON to NSClient INI.** JSON is the only format on the wire and
   in the control plane; INI exists solely as the final on-disk artifact. The JSON → INI
   mapping is deterministic and schema-driven and lives in the agent.
4. Write config + scripts to a staging directory, then swap atomically (rename) and
   reload/restart NSClient.
5. Only after the swap succeeds, persist `state_hash` as the new `current_hash`.

If any step fails, roll back to the previous config, keep the old `current_hash`, and
report the failure (next section). Never leave the host half-applied.

## 2. State report

After every apply attempt — success or failure — and also right after startup:

```
POST {mtls_url}/agent/v1/state-report
{
  "applied_state_hash": "3f2a…",
  "bundles_installed": [ { "id": "01J…", "version": "2.1.0" } ],
  "errors": [],
  "reported_tags": { "os": "windows", "os_version": "2019", "sql_server_present": "true" },
  "local_config_present": false
}
```

All fields are optional. Semantics, exactly as the server implements them:

- `applied_state_hash` present → stored as the host's `current_state_hash` and
  `last_seen_at` is refreshed. The operator's host list compares it against what the server
  would serve that host now, and shows **in sync** only when the two match — so reporting the
  hash is what takes a host out of **out of sync**. Omit it (or send `null`) after a failed
  apply: the server still refreshes `last_seen_at`, and the host stays out of sync, which is
  the truth.
- Keep polling even when there is nothing to do. The status is derived from `last_seen_at`
  as well, and silence outranks the hash — a hash reported days ago says nothing about what
  is running now:

  | silence | status | what the operator reads into it |
  |---|---|---|
  | 24 hours | **offline** | powered off, away or off the network; it may come back on its own |
  | `HOST_LOST_AFTER_HOURS`, 48h by default | **lost** | the agent is stopped, removed, firewalled or the machine is gone |

  Both are measured from the last contact of any kind — a poll, a heartbeat or a state
  report — so an agent with nothing to say still keeps itself out of them by polling.
- `reported_tags` → upserted with `source = 'agent'`. Manual (operator-set) tags are
  never touched. If any value actually **changed**, the server bumps the tenant's
  config version — which can change your next desired state, since tags drive group
  membership. Re-sending identical tags is a no-op, so the simplest correct behavior is
  to send the full tag map on every report.
- `errors` → logged server-side against the host. Put bundle verification failures,
  apply failures, and INI render errors here as human-readable strings.
- `local_config_present` → stored on the host and surfaced in the UI as a **local config**
  badge. See below.

### 2.1 Local configuration

`local_config_present` answers one question: does this host carry configuration of its own
that **outranks** what we send it? On NSClient a lookup reads the local store first and only
falls back to the fleet-managed include, so a locally set key silently shadows the fleet's
value — the host can be in sync and still not be running what the operator sees.

Report **only the fact**. Never send the local configuration itself, or any part of it: it
routinely holds credentials, and the server has no field for it. The flag exists so an
operator can tell which hosts are only partly centrally managed without anything sensitive
leaving the host.

Send it on **every** report, in both directions — `false` is a real answer and the server
stores it as one. Omitting the field means "no answer", which is what an agent older than
this field looks like, and the server keeps those apart:

| what you send | what the server stores | what the UI shows |
|---|---|---|
| `true` | reported: partly self-managed | **local config** badge on the host |
| `false` | reported: fully fleet-managed | nothing in the list; stated on the host page |
| field omitted | unknown — and any earlier answer is **kept**, not cleared | "not reported by this agent" |

An unchanged answer is not a write server-side, so reporting it every time costs nothing.
Unlike tags it never bumps the tenant's config version: it describes the host, and is not an
input to desired state.

Practical tag guidance: report observed facts (`os`, versions, detected services) —
these are what operators write selectors against, e.g. `sql_server_present = "true"`
pulling the SQL monitoring bundle. Values are strings; booleans by convention are
`"true"` / `"false"`. Report tags **early** (first report right after startup, before
the first poll) so a fresh host lands in its groups before it asks for desired state.

## 3. Certificate lifecycle

Client certs live 90 days. When the current cert is within **14 days** of expiry:

```
POST {mtls_url}/agent/v1/renew
{ "csr_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----…" }
```

- Authenticated by the existing (still-valid) mTLS cert — no bootstrap token.
- Generate a **fresh keypair** for the CSR; only its public key is used (the server
  constructs the certificate identity itself from the mTLS context).
- Response: `{ cert_pem, ca_pem, mtls_server_cert_pem, bundle_signing_pub_pem }`.
  Persist **all four plus the new private key** atomically, then swap the in-memory
  identity. Refreshing `bundle_signing_pub_pem` and `mtls_server_cert_pem` here is how
  server-side key rotation reaches agents — never skip them.
- The old cert stays valid until natural expiry, so a crash between renew and persist
  is recoverable: retry with the old identity.

If the cert expires before renewal (host offline too long), every mTLS call fails at
the handshake. There is no self-service recovery — the operator must issue a new
bootstrap token ("Add host") and the agent re-enrolls.

`GET /agent/v1/heartbeat` remains available as a cheap liveness/identity check (it also
refreshes `last_seen_at`, and returns `403` if the cert was revoked) — useful at
startup before entering the loop.

## 4. Error handling summary

| Response | Meaning | Agent behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `304` on desired-state | up to date | sleep `next_poll_in_seconds` + jitter |
| `429` + `Retry-After` | pacing/budget exceeded | wait exactly `Retry-After`, resume normal cadence |
| `403` on bundle download | bundle no longer in effective set | abandon cycle, re-poll |
| `403` on any agent route | certificate revoked or the host was deleted | stop; operator intervention (re-enroll) |
| TLS handshake failure | cert expired/revoked, or server cert rotated | if before expiry: retry with backoff; if expired: re-enroll |
| `5xx` / network error | transient server trouble | exponential backoff with jitter, cap at ~5× poll interval; keep running last-applied config |

Two invariants above all: **never apply an unverified bundle**, and **never report a
state hash you did not fully apply**. A host that is honestly out-of-sync is a visible,
fixable condition; a host that lies about its state is not.
