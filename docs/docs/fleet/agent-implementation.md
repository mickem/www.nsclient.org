# Building the Agent

This document describes how to implement the real (production) agent for
NSClient Fleet. The protocol is fully pull-based: the agent enrolls once
using a one-time bootstrap token, then drives everything itself over mTLS —
polling for desired state, downloading and verifying bundles, and reporting
back. The server never pushes to the agent.

A working reference client lives in `crates/agent-sim/src/lib.rs`, and the full
lifecycle is exercised end-to-end in `crates/server/tests/fleet_flow.rs` and
`crates/server/tests/poll_flow.rs`. Any real agent should behave identically on
the wire.

Once an agent is enrolled, the day-to-day operating contract (config sync, state
reporting, renewal, error handling) is specified in
[agent-integration.md](agent-integration.md).

```

## 1. Enrollment

The user adds a host in the UI/API; the server returns an `install_command`
containing a **bootstrap token** (a JWT wrapping a one-time nonce, expiring
after `bootstrap_ttl_secs`). The agent is started with this token and:

1. Generates an **Ed25519 keypair**. This is the agent's long-term identity key
   until the next renewal.
2. Builds a PKCS#10 **CSR** from it (CN can be anything, e.g. `client` — the
   server sets the real identity in the issued cert from the token's claims).
3. Sends, over plain public HTTPS:

```
POST {server_url}/enroll/v1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "bootstrap_token": "<token from install command>",
  "csr_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----…",
  "hostname": "web-01",        // optional
  "os": "linux"                // optional
}
```

Success response (`200`):

```jsonc
{
  "cert_pem": "…",                 // client cert signed by the tenant CA
  "ca_pem": "…",                   // tenant CA cert
  "bundle_signing_pub_pem": "…",   // Ed25519 public key for bundle signatures
  "server_url": "…",               // public API base
  "mtls_url": "…",                 // base URL for all /agent/v1/* calls
  "mtls_server_cert_pem": "…"      // cert to pin when connecting to mtls_url
}
```

Persist **all of this plus the private key** to durable storage (e.g.
`agent-state.json` / a state directory with `0600` permissions). Enrollment
cannot be repeated: the server burns the nonce atomically on first use
(`crates/storage/src/repos.rs`, `mark_enrolled_if_pending`), so a replayed or
expired token gets a `4xx`. If the state file is lost, the user must create a
new host (or re-issue a token) server-side.

Failure handling:

- `401/403` — token invalid, expired, or already used. Do not retry; surface a
  clear error telling the user to generate a new install command.
- `429` — per-tenant enrollment rate limit. Back off and retry with jitter.

## 2. The mTLS client

Every call after enrollment goes to `mtls_url` using:

- **ALPN**: offer `nsclient-fleet/1` — first, with `http/1.1` after it. **Not optional.**
- **Client auth**: the issued `cert_pem` + the locally generated private key.
- **Server trust**: pin `mtls_server_cert_pem` as the only root — do not use
  the system trust store for this connection.

The server side resolves `(tenant_id, host_id)` from the client cert, so no
request body ever carries identity — there is no host-id header or token.

### Why ALPN is mandatory

`mtls_url` usually points at port 443, shared with the operator web UI. The
server picks which TLS configuration to use by reading ALPN out of your
ClientHello: `nsclient-fleet/1` gets the pinned certificate and a client-certificate
request; anything else gets the public web certificate and no client-cert
request. Omit it and the connection *appears* to work at the TCP level, then
fails pin validation with a confusing "untrusted certificate" error.

Send `nsclient-fleet/1` unconditionally. It is harmless against a deployment that runs a
dedicated mTLS port, which advertises both `nsclient-fleet/1` and `http/1.1`.

The constant is defined once, in `crates/proto` (`fleet_proto::AGENT_ALPN`).

## 3. Poll loop: desired state

```
GET {mtls_url}/agent/v1/desired-state?current_hash=<last applied hash>
```

Omit `current_hash` on the very first poll.

Responses:

- **`304 Not Modified`** — you are up to date. Body:
  `{"next_poll_in_seconds": N}`. Sleep `N` seconds, poll again.
- **`200 OK`** — new state:

```json
{
  "tenant_id": 7,
  "state_hash": "…",
  "next_poll_in_seconds": 60,
  "merged_config_json": {},
  "bundles": [
    {
      "id": "…",
      "name": "…",
      "version": "…",
      "sha256": "<hex digest of the bundle bytes>",
      "signature": "<base64 Ed25519 signature over this bundle's descriptor>",
      "url": "/agent/v1/bundles/<id>",
      "priority": 10,
      "format": "plain"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`429 Too Many Requests`** — you polled faster than your tier's
  `min_poll_interval_secs`. Honor the `Retry-After` header. Treat
  `next_poll_in_seconds` from previous responses as authoritative cadence; the
  server derives it from the tenant tier, so never hardcode an interval.

Notes:

- `tenant_id` identifies the tenant these bundles belong to. You need it to
  verify a bundle signature (§4); it is sent rather than derived because your
  certificate carries the tenant *slug*, not this id. There is nothing to trust
  here — a wrong value simply fails signature verification, since the verifying
  key is per tenant.
- `merged_config_json` is currently always `{}` — real configuration lives
  inside bundle contents; the agent is responsible for unpacking and applying
  them (see `crates/server/src/desired_state.rs`).
- `state_hash` covers the merged config **and** the bundle set. Store it only
  after a successful apply, and echo it as `current_hash` on subsequent polls.
- Add jitter to the sleep to avoid thundering-herd across a fleet.

## 4. Bundle download and verification

For each entry in `bundles` (process in ascending `priority` order):

1. `GET {mtls_url}{bundle.url}` — the server re-checks that the bundle is in
   this host's effective set and returns `403` otherwise. What bounds that set
   is group membership, and group membership is only as trustworthy as the
   tags the selectors read: a selector clause that accepts `agent`-sourced
   tags can be satisfied by a host claiming the tag in its own state report.
   Clauses default to operator-set tags precisely so that the effective set is
   not something the host chooses — see §5.
2. **Verify integrity**: SHA-256 of the raw bytes must equal `sha256` (hex).
3. **Verify authenticity**: `signature` is a base64 Ed25519 signature over the
   bundle's **descriptor** — not over the bytes, and not over their digest
   alone — verified with `bundle_signing_pub_pem` obtained at enrollment.

   The descriptor is the identity the server advertised for this bundle,
   serialised as a version prefix followed by six NUL-separated fields:

   ```
   nsclient-fleet/bundle-sig/v2 \0 tenant_id \0 id \0 name \0 version \0 format \0 sha256
   ```

   `tenant_id` is the top-level field of the same desired-state response;
   everything else comes from this bundle's entry, verbatim, including the
   `sha256` you just checked the bytes against. Sign nothing yourself and
   reconstruct nothing — read the fields out of the response, because what you
   are verifying is the server's own claim about *what this bundle is*.

   A signature over the digest alone would say only "this tenant's server saw
   these bytes once", which lets an old signed blob be re-advertised under a
   different name, version or id. Reference implementation:
   `fleet_core::bundlesig`.
4. **Decrypt if sealed**: bytes starting with the `NSEB1` magic are a
   client-side-encrypted envelope (`format: "enc-v1"`); decrypt with the
   locally-configured bundle key, using the advertised `name`/`version` as
   AAD. Detect by the magic, not the `format` field. Full format, key
   provisioning, and the `require_encrypted_bundles` hardening flag:
   `agent-integration.md` §1.2.1; reference implementations in
   `fleet_core::encbundle` and `EnrolledAgent::open_bundle` in
   `crates/agent-sim`.
5. Only then unpack (bundles are zip archives) and apply the contents.

Reject and report (via `errors` in the state report) on any mismatch or
decrypt failure — never apply an unverified bundle. Cache verified bundles by
`(id, sha256)` so an unchanged bundle in a new desired state is not
re-downloaded.

## 5. State report

After applying (or failing to apply) a desired state:

```
POST {mtls_url}/agent/v1/state-report
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "applied_state_hash": "<state_hash you successfully applied, or null>",
  "bundles_installed": [],
  "errors": ["…any apply/verify failures…"],
  "reported_tags": { "os": "linux", "role": "web" },
  "local_config_present": false
}
```

All fields are optional server-side (`crates/server/src/agent_api.rs`,
`StateReport`). Semantics:

- `applied_state_hash` set → server records it and updates `last_seen_at`.
  Omit it (null) when nothing was applied; the server still touches
  `last_seen_at`. It must be exactly 64 hex characters — it is the SHA-256 the
  server sent you and nothing else is meaningful; anything else is a `400`.
- `reported_tags` → **the host's complete set of self-reported tags**, stored
  with `source = "agent"` and kept distinct from tags an operator set. Send the
  full map every time: it *replaces* what was stored, so a key you stop
  reporting is removed rather than left standing. Omitting the field entirely
  means "no answer" and leaves the stored set alone; an explicit `{}` is an
  answer and clears it. Resending an identical map is a no-op.

  Capped at 128 tags, keys at 128 bytes and values at 256 bytes — the same
  limits a selector can compare, so anything longer could never be matched. Over
  any of them the whole report is refused with `400`.

  A change here affects only *this* host's next desired-state poll (tags feed
  group selectors); it does not disturb any other host in the tenant.

  **Trust boundary.** These tags are the host's claims about itself and are
  treated as such. A selector clause reads operator-set tags only unless it
  says `"source": "agent"` or `"source": "any"`, so reporting `role=sql_server`
  does not by itself put a host in the SQL group. An operator who does write a
  clause over agent tags is stating that hosts in that tenant may place
  themselves in that group, and the console says so at the point they write it.
  Anything gating access to scripts or secrets should stay on operator tags.
- `errors` → logged server-side; use it for bundle verification or apply
  failures. At most 32 entries of 512 characters reach the log; send a summary,
  not a log file.
- `local_config_present` → whether the host has configuration of its own that
  takes precedence over what you were sent. Send the fact on every report, both
  ways round, and **never** send the configuration itself — it typically holds
  credentials. Omitting the field means "no answer" and leaves any previous
  answer standing. Full contract:
  [agent-integration.md §2.1](agent-integration.md#21-local-configuration).

Report tags early (right after enrollment, before the first apply) so the host
gets matched into groups and receives its real desired state promptly — for the
groups whose selectors opt into agent tags. A host that matches only
operator-set selectors is placed by the operator, and reporting tags changes
nothing about its membership.

## 6. Certificate renewal

Client certs expire (`client_cert_lifetime_days` server config). Well before
expiry (e.g. at 2/3 of lifetime), while the current cert is still valid:

1. Generate a **fresh** Ed25519 keypair and CSR.
2. `POST {mtls_url}/agent/v1/renew` with `{"csr_pem": "…"}` — authenticated by
   the existing mTLS cert; no bootstrap token is involved.
3. Response mirrors enrollment: `cert_pem`, `ca_pem`, `mtls_server_cert_pem`,
   `bundle_signing_pub_pem`. Persist the new key + material **atomically**
   (write temp file, fsync, rename) and swap the in-memory identity. The old
   cert stays valid server-side until its natural expiry, so a crash between
   renew and persist is recoverable as long as you don't delete the old key
   until the new material is durably stored.

Also refresh `bundle_signing_pub_pem` and `mtls_server_cert_pem` from the
renew response — this is how server-side key rotation reaches agents.

There is also `GET {mtls_url}/agent/v1/heartbeat` for a cheap liveness check,
useful at startup to validate the stored identity before entering the loop.

## 7. Suggested agent structure

```
agent
├── identity.rs      // keypair gen, CSR, state file load/store (atomic writes)
├── enroll.rs        // one-shot bootstrap → EnrolledAgent material
├── transport.rs     // mTLS client construction (pinned server cert)
├── poll.rs          // desired-state loop, 304/200/429 handling, jitter
├── bundles.rs       // download, sha256 + Ed25519 verify, cache, unpack
├── apply.rs         // apply bundle contents / local config
├── report.rs        // state-report + tag collection
└── renew.rs         // cert lifecycle
```

Main loop sketch:

```text
load state file
  ├─ none + bootstrap token given → enroll, persist, report initial tags
  └─ none + no token → exit with instructions
heartbeat (sanity-check identity; on cert-expired → surface re-enroll guidance)
loop:
  if cert past renewal threshold → renew + persist
  ds = fetch_desired_state(current_hash)
  if 200:
      for bundle in ds.bundles (by priority): download, verify, stage
      apply all-or-nothing; on success current_hash = ds.state_hash
      report_state(current_hash or null, tags, errors)
  sleep next_poll_in_seconds (+ jitter)
```

## 9. Reference material

| Concern                                             | Reference                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wire-level client (all endpoints)                   | `crates/agent-sim/src/lib.rs`                                           |
| Enrollment server-side                              | `crates/server/src/hosts.rs` (`enroll`)                                 |
| Desired-state / state-report / renew handlers       | `crates/server/src/agent_api.rs`                                        |
| Desired-state computation (tags → groups → bundles) | `crates/server/src/desired_state.rs`                                    |
| Bundle download authz                               | `crates/server/src/bundles.rs` (`download`)                             |
| Route wiring (public vs mTLS router)                | `crates/server/src/lib.rs`                                              |
| End-to-end lifecycle tests                          | `crates/server/tests/fleet_flow.rs`, `crates/server/tests/poll_flow.rs` |

The simulator uses `rcgen` (keys/CSRs), `rustls` + `reqwest` (mTLS),
`ed25519-dalek` (signature verify), and `sha2` — a real Rust agent can reuse
these choices directly; an agent in another language just needs Ed25519,
SHA-256, PKCS#10 CSRs, and mTLS with a pinned server cert.
