# 0.6.9 Fix installer bug

## New versions out


As you probably notice, I do not always update the news section when new versions are released.
If you want to know about new versions, you can always check the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/mickem/nscp/releases)
Instead here I post when there are new and important updates.

And the latest release fixes an important installer issue where upgrading from 0.4.x or 0.5.x would wipe the existing configuration.
So be sure you do not upgrade to any of the older versions unless you want to reconfigure.
Other changes include some more installer issues and WEB server issues as well as new signature for the MSI files.

## Changes

* Fixes config is overwritten by installer when upgrading from 0.4.x or 0.5.x
* Makes TLS default for web server (so enabled web server will now be exposed on `https://localhost:8443`)
* Fixed broken TLS support in the WEBServer
* Added signatures to MSI (currently using a "personal signature" as I haven't managed to get Microsoft to cooperate)
* Metrics added to the WebUI and new welcome screen
