Hello,

I have done some site updates, this is a bit of a work in progress but
hopefully things will become a bit simpler to use...

Currently I have migrated the forums to http://forums.nsclient.org as
well as closed down the "answers section" as it was kind of crappy.
please use the forums hence forth for all questions.

If you have previous posts in the forums you should be able to just ask
the site to resend your password to get your account back. I will in the
next few days enable social logins as well as the current site login.

There is also some strange issue with the top 20 or so posts which are
old, all the others are sorted by date, but somehow the import decided
the first 20 posts were the "most recent".

As always, please do let me know what you think...
