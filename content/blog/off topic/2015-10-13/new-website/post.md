I have created a new website which I think is btter, it is for sure a lot faster.
It it still a bit of a work in progress so I need to convert some old blog posts.
Clean up some parts as well as optimize things a bit.

As always there are bound to be things not working so please do let me know any issue you have.

I have ben working on NSCLient++ as well and will quite soon release both a new 0.4.3 build (which has some installer fixes) as well as a beta version of the up-coming 0.4.4 version.
