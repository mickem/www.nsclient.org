TO make life simpler, nicer and prettier I have moved some of the old
trac feature over to the wordpress site as well as starting to cleanup
the old trac site. Going forwards the trac site will be explicitly about
development and thus tickets and source code will be the primary
focus.<!--more-->

hopefully you have noticed that i have migrated the forums from track to
bbpress this means the forums now have a new URL and a new (hopefully)
nicer interface.  The main drawback is that all users and notifications
have been reset.  If you create a new user (social login) on this site
and email me I can move your posts to your user.

Please also do let me know about any issues or things that do not work
and if login oes not work so you are unable to post comments/forums
things feelfree to email me at michael&lt;AT&gt;medin&lt;DOT&gt;name ot
info&lt;AT&gt;nsclient&lt;DOT&gt;org.

Hopefully this solution will be better and easier to maintain but if not
please do let me know!
