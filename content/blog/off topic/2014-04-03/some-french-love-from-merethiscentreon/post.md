Hello.

Merethis, the company behind Centreon, is a sponsor of NSClient++ and
yesterday they blogged about sponsoring NSClient++ whilst giving a quick
introduction to NSClient++. Since I recently have some french questions
coming I thought this would be an excellent time to provide some
information about NSClient++ in the French language. To be frank the
likelihood of me writing anything here about NSClient++ in French is
rather slim given that I was thrown out of French class in the seventh
grade.

And speaking of Merethis their product Centreon is a nice monitoring
suite based on Nagios which has most things you need "out of the box" as
opposed to rolling it all on your own so be sure to check them out as
well regardless of if you speak French or not. Their product is not
French only so no worries there.

You can find the blog post

if you speak French be sure to check it out!
