Hello, I have cleaned out the user database as there was a lot of spam
email and "strange users". So what you need to do is go to password
reset dialog enter you user id and email address to request a new
password (which will arrive via email).
\[\[http://nsclient.org/nscp/reset\_password\]\] I have also activated
authentication emails (instead of spam filter) so lets see if this works
better. Hopefully spam bots does not have too many valid emails... //
