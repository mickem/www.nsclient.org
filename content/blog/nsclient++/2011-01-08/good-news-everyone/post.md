Title: Good news everyone!

The latest commit now features a complete build with cmake so now we are
getting close to alpha versions of 0.4.x. I still need to migrate some
settings and a few other such things over to the new "kitt" but from
then onwards 0.4.x will be usable (apart from all the bugs) as a
replacement for 0.3.x. Notice the installer is not yet done and
cmake/wix integration seems a bit sketchy so might be a bit work to get
working. Also there is a lot of rough edges in many places so will be
several months before we can release anything but just letting you know
we are making good progress... // Michael Medin
