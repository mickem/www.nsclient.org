Hello, If you have an old account please attempt to recover your
password and let me know if it works, and/or if it does not. As I, might
not have said, the changes were due to replacing a file based password
store with a database based one so importing passwords was not
"possible" as I only store hashes and they have (or so I think)
different hashing algorithms. // Michael Medin
