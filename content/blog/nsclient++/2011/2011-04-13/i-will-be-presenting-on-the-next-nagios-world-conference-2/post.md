A quick heads up that I will be giving an update on the Nagios World
Conference in Bolzano Italy in may this year. I will go through whats
new in the 0.3.9 version (which will hopefully be out by then) as well
as the up-coming 0.4.x which will also (hopefully) be out by then (in
beta). So if you want to know what going on with NSClient++ that's the
place to be. And if you do not want to know that there are plenty of
other speakers for you as well. For the details go to:
\[www.wuerth-phoenix.com/world-conference\] And if you do go be sure to
bump into me to tell me all you want me to add in the next release of
NSClient++! // Michael Medin
