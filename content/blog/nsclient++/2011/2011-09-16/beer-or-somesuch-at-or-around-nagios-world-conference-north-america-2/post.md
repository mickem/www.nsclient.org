Hello, I will be attending (and speaking) at the Nagios World
Conference: North America so if anyone want to grab a beer or just wanna
meetup and ask some question or have some ideas feel free to drop me a
line at michael<at>medin<dot>name,

details can be found at \[\[MickeM\]\]. I will be therr all week
(Saturday till Saturday) and I normally try to be "online" when I travel
but I am unsure how 3G internet cash card work in the US so I cant
