Title: Spring cleaning!

I have gone through the tickets (some of them) and tried to close the
ones which have been fixed as well as respond to all forum posts. I will
in a bit start build the next RC for 0.3.9 and hopefully that will be
out tonight or tomorrow (depends on how long it takes I guess). After
that I shall (hopefully tomorrow) build and "release" the first nightly
build of 0.4.0 (long awaited, and long promised)... // Michael Medin
