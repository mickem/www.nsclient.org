Title: New nightly build

Hello, The new file check is alive and well in the latest nightly build.
Also written a wiki page for it \[CheckFiles\] here. There are also the
same kind of changes in \[CheckTaskSched\] but I need to run through
some tests there and also write up a wiki page about it. I have also
built this on a new version stack of all libraries (as I was forced to
buy a new computer when my previous one broke). So there might be
missing libraries and such if so please let me know. '''NOTICE:''' \*
CheckFile is '''REMOVED''' \* CheckFile2 might have issues (haven't
verified much) \* CheckTaskSched has the new filter syntax.
