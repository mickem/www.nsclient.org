I am looking for people interested in distributed monitoring! As some of
you might know I am building some features do manage distributed and
incoherent monitoring (ie. more then one monitoring tool) so I am
interested in getting some real world insight into this area. So if you
or anyone you know are interested in this area and want to come with
feedback on some ideas I have please don't hesitate to contact me
(michael <at> medin <dot> name). Also on a bit more sad note, lack of
updates on the wiki/forums is due to ion part preparing for NWC but also
on me trying to complete some new cool(?) features which hopefully shall
be out this week. // Michael Medin
