I have added some caching to css/js which will make the site a bit
snappier as well as (I hope) reduce the load on the slice. I was at a
customer doing a review on a public "high profile" website and remarked
on this issue and on the way home I got to thinking... wonder if I do
that on my trac site... and apparently I did not as the performance
increased a lot (at least for me). As always let me know if you have any
problems with it... Also, tonight there will be some sweet updates as
well! (if you do not want to wait another 24 or so hours, try the
installer for the latest nightly build... :) // Michael Medin
