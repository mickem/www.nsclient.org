I post a quick post on my blog which details the reason for me being
"away". http://blog.medin.name/2012/06/10/family-augmentations/.
Executive summary: My second daughter was born 2012-05-21 and since then
I have been a bit busy tending to my family :) This means I am "back"
but things will be a bit slow as I have to spend more time taking care
of my family now... But hopefully in a week or so the long promised nrdp
support will be out. Last few weeks I have focused on extending the
real-time the event log checks as well as rework the socket libraries to
be easier to use but all that is now complete so next up is fixes for
0.4.0 and then NRDP!
