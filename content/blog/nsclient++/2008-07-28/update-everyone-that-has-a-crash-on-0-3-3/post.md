''Resolved''' or so they tell me... Could you try the nightly in "test
mode". I would like to know what causes the crash. If you start a
command prompt (ie. Start-&gt;Run, "cmd", <enter>) and run the
following:

     cd  nsclient++ /stop nsclient++ /test # wait till it crashes, and post the log to me (feel free to search replace out any IP/port/passwords). nsclient++ /start 

The latest nightly has some changes that might change some "crashes"
into proper errors (I have changed a few assets into exceptions).
Nightly can be found under download and is called:
NSClient++-Win32-20080728-2044.zip I have gotten reports that this new
build fixes this issue so let me know if it remains if not I will
release a bug fixed version in the next few days or so. // MickeM
