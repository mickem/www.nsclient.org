Hello again, RC3 is out with two changes to event log. I will also
(during the weekend) be upgrading trac to 0.11 in hopes to reduce spam
(as it allows email verification for registration of users). Change log:

     2009-02-05 MickeM * Fixed so the error message for "to small eventlog buffer" specifies the required size. * Changed so that event log buffer problems are "ignored in the result" (still logged in the error log).
