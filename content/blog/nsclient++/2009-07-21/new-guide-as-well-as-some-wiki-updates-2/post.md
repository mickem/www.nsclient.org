Hello everyone (yes, I know.. no one reads this but anyways feels better
pretending not talk to myself)... I have added a new guide (it I hope
illustrates the basics of using NSClient++ with Nagios) on how to check
if a process is running on a windows machine. It draws upon the earlier
guides I published recently and tries to be very through and detailed.
Please let me know if they are helpful or not and how I can improve
them. I have also reworked the "menu system" for the wiki to something
slightly more "compact" and hopefully easier to work with, please let me
know what you think. ||'''Old'''||'''New'''
||\[\[Image(old.png)\]\]||\[\[Image(new.png)\]\] Also don't forget the
Netways Conferance this fall: I will also give a presentation on
Application Monitoring where I will dive into how to monitor your Java
based middleware via (amongst other things) JMX. Details on the
conference can be found at the web page
