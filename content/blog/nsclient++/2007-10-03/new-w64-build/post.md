New nightly (w64) up witch should (I hope) work on w64... Let me know
how it turns out, this is an "initial build" I shall look over the code
and such so only use for testing (but please do use it for testing).
There might be issues with wrong pointer size and such here and there.
Also found a slight problem with the nsclient listener that might have
caused the "invalid password" issue that some have experienced but I
shall investigate that a bit more before I close the issue. Changelog
