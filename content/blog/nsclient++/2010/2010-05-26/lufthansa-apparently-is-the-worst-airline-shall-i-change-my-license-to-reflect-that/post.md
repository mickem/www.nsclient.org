Title: Lufthansa apparently is the worst airline, shall I change my license to reflect that?

Hello, I have a question for you (the general public, the community,
the...) Would it be considered bad/immature/evil/\* to add a clause to
the license for the binaries which denies for instance Lufthansa to use
NSClient++? This would not change the source code (which would still be
OSS) but it would restrict them from using the binaries I provide. The
reason in short is they f\*cked me right up the \*ss when I was flying
with them last week (ended up getting home one day later paying over 300
euro extra). Then in addition to this their "customer support" where
extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. In essence they told "ohh... your
life sucks, go buy a new one, I don't really care..." And I am thinking
(since I have hits from them) they are essentially using my program for
free yet they care nothing for me when I am their customer? So this is
one of those questions, shall I give freely to someone who only takes
from me? // Michael Medin
