Hello community! Awesome to see someone actually helping out here :P
Really really nice! Also if there are any handy unix using people out
there I will starting next week be doing a small (controlled) alpha of
the up-coming 0.4.x branch which will (in addition to windows) also run
on unix. The version is far from finished but it would be interesting to
see how well it builds out there in the "big world" outside my Debian
here at home. The features currently supported in the 0.4.x branch is:
\* NRPE Server \* NRPE Client \* NSCA Client \* Scheduler (NSCA does not
have one anymore) \* Logging (to text file) \* CheckHelpers (simplest
module) \* CheckExternalScripts I would also really really like to get
feedback on what people would like to see in the form of features and
such. Especially on \*nix where I am just now starting to thread
lightly... Also feel free to let me know if I am stone crazy and should
give upon this! :) And again wicked big thanks to everyone who helps out
and such on the forum/wiki/\* here!!! // Michael Medin
