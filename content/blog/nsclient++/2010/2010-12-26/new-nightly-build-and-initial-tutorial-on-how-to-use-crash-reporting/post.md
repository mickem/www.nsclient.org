Hello everyone a new nightly build is out which has the first "feature
complete" crash reporting concept. So please try it out and met me know
how it goes. I have started a tutorial on how to use both the crash
reports but also how to use the new \[check\_nscp\] command which checks
the health of NSClient++. \[wiki:doc/usage/nscp/crash\] // Michael Medin
