Hello, I would like to welcome Opsera as a Gold sponsor for the
NSClient++ project. In other news I have been mad busy at work and with
Windows 7 installes so nothing in the ways of updates. But hopefully
after the weekend. Also I can say: "Windows 7?" I actually dont get the
hype. What is "new" it is pretty much like "XP" so in that regard it is
a lot better then Vista (which I hated) but I cant really say there is
much of a reason to upgrade from XP? Most of the "addons" I already had
in the form of third party products... Well, we shall see, maybe it will
grow on me? (still havent installed a US enligh spellchecker in Firefox
so excuse my spelling errors :) // Michael Medin
