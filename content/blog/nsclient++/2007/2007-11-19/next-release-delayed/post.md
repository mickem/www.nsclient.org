Title: next release delayed :(

Have a bit of sad news, just discovered that Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2
does not build programs that run on NT 4.0 (regardless of SP) so I shall
have to revert back to 2005 again. This will take me a while to
"back-port" my build environment \*sigh\* not a show stopper but will
take a bit of time. In the meantime let me know any bugs as the "next
version" is now "feature complete" and as soon as it "runs" on NT it
will be out. // Michael Medin
