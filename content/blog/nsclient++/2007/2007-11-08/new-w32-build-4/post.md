Title: New w32 build!
Author: mickem
Status: published

Feature compleate (unless someone has any throught) WMI plugin (much
better now I hope). Will start to wrap up now, will run a bit more
extensive test during the weekend and then maybe next week a new version
unless I get any nasty new bugs. Fixed issue(s): \#89

     2007-11-08 MickeM + Added CheckWMIValue to check result-values from a WMI Query * Changed so performance values are "collapsed" ie 75362115584 = 70.0G (#89) If anyone dont want this let me know and I will make an option for it. 2007-11-06 MickeM + Added CLI interface to CheckWMI to check queries
