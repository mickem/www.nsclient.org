Title: Cleaned up tickets!

I have cleaned up all tickets and closed old and outdated ones. So if
your ticket is not listed among the ones for milestone 0.3.0 it will mot
likely not be in the next version (unless you convince me it is a good
idea) and if your issue has been closed (and you still have the issue)
feel free to reopen it. There is also a new w32/x64 build out that fixes
a pretty nasty socket issue I had inadvertently added. So \*grab\* the
new version if you are using nightlies or you will have a lot of nasty
issues.
