Author: mickem
Status: published

New nightly (x64/w32) up witch should (I hope) work on w64 and w32.
Fixed in this version is a new automated "build system" so revisions and
dates should reflect build-date and not
when-i-remembered-to-change-dates. Also cleaned up the w32 builds to fit
with the x64 clean-up I did yesterday. Again the Changelog highlights

     2007-10-06 MickeM + Added auto-update of versions and dates on build to make versions better updated. + Fixed x64 build and cleanup a bit.
