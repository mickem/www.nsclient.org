Hello, Just thought I'd post a short notice since I (Michael Medin) will
be speaking on the up-coming "Nordic Meet on Nagios 09" conference. I
will again speak on windows monitoring (this time more advanced stuff)
and in addition to this I will also hold a workshop where I will look
more into application monitoring both Java and .net as well as some WMI.
