Hello, Just to let people know the reason I have been offline is due to
some vacationing in China and Vietnam. Unfortunetly the internet
situation here is not what it is in europe, parently the meain telco
only has "G3" which I guess is chinese for making people think GPRS and
edge is really really fast (it is not). And to top it off I lost my
phone in a cab in Vietnam!!! (AGH!!!) so I only have sporadic acess to
internet. So I probably wont resond till I get back in a week or two.
But right now I dont really care! I am in heaven! Shenzhen, where they
sell lots and lots and lots of cool stuff! // Michael Medin
