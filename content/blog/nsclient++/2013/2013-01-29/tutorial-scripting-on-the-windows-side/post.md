custom scripts which makes it one of the most powerful monitoring
systems. Now Nagios is not the only place where you can extend your
monitoring! NSClient++ provides many ways to extend it with scripts and
since I have gotten many questions about how to use scripts with
NSClient++ lately I have decided to write this tutorial to help sort out
the concepts.'' Read the entire post here:
