Hello everyone (read google bot)! Just thought Id let you know whats
happening lately, I have been working a lot with 0.4.2 on the
documentation generation and managed to add almost all "kinds" of
modules now (still some loose end with the Client interface). This means
I will very soon (read in the next week or so) update ALL the
documentation to reflect the new version of NSClient++. So please have a
look at the converted pages and let me know what you think about the
content. \* \[wiki:CheckLogFile\] \*
\[wiki:CheckLogFile/check\_logfile\] \* \[wiki:CheckDisk\] \*
\[wiki:CheckDisk/check\_drivesize\] \* \[wiki:CauseCrashes\] \*
\[wiki:CauseCrashes/crash\_client\] If you havent noticed one of the big
changes in 0.4.1 is that configuration is now self documenting and for
0.4.2 the idea is that ALL commands will be slef documenting. This means
all commands will support "check\_xxx help" which will return a list of
available options and they can be used for. I hope this will both
simplify my life but also create a much higher quality documentation!
0.4.2 will "hopefully" also ship with proper reference manuals (so you
wont have to go to the wiki quite as much)! // Michael Medin
