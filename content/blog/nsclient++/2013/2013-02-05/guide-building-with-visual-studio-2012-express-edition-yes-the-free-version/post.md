Since I managed to get NSClient++ to build with Visual Studio 2012 I
created a guide to help me (and other people) set things up correctly.
It requires some hands-on mainly due to some of the dependencies from
Google not working correctly with 2012. But this means '''you can build
NSClient++ on Windows for free!''' which I think is really nice. So now
there is no reason at all not to help out! Find the guide here:
