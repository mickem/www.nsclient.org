Just a heads up: It is now 30+ degrees (centigrades) in Sweden so I am
(and have been for the past week) in vacation mode which means I update
things rather less frequently then i normally do. If something is urgent
drop me an email at michael <at> medin <dot> name (mention NSClient++ in
the subject) and I will try to deal with it "slightly more" then
elsewhere. I will hopefully try to work off the backlog every other week
or so so not to seldom... // Michael Medin
