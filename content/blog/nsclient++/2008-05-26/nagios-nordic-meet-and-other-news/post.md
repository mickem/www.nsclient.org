Good news everyone (if you live in Sweden and/or the Nordic region). I
shall be attending the Nagios Nordic Meet
(\[http://www.nagiosnordicmeet.wmr.se/\]) so if you have any questions
ideas or suggestions please feel free to bump into me and ask them live
:) The attendance has been kindly sponsored by OP5
(\[http://www.op5.se\]). And in other news the new settings systems is
"working" (and a huge improvement if you ask me) and I am now playing
around with the API and a mock-up of a future configuration UI! So
expect betas for 0.4.0 hopefully soon after the conference. As always I
am swamped in problems, this time a water main broke in my wall so last
week I was living "with friends" so everything takes a lot longer, but I
have an "evacuation apartment" now but it still means half my stuff are
in my old apartment and half is at a friends place with the last half
(yes I suck at math) in my new apartment. Fortunately I live in Sweden,
the land of cheap wireless broadband, so I am actually programming via
terminal server over a HSDPA wireless modem! And it works splendidly so
hopefully hence forth I shall be better insulated against water leaks :)
