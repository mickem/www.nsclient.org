Hello, We now have the first beta version of 0.4.0 released. The main
goal of this version is to verify that everything works "smoothly" for
existing users. So essentally try to upgrade an existing 0.3.x version
and let me know if everything is working out alright. Everything
'''should''' be the same after upgrading to 0.4.0 and you should not
notice any differences. But this is an early release so please be
carefull as it probably will have many issues and defects yet. But it
would realley help me and speed things along if a lot of people could
help test this version with various existing configurations. Also please
do a backup of your existing configuration before installing this
version (in case the installer is broken). '''Download:''' \*
