Just a quick shout to let everyone know I have updated the road map and
classified all tickets (ish) as well as assigned them to 0.4.0, 0.4.1
and future. The idea with the next few versions are: milestone:0.4.0::
RC2 out now, release in the next month or so. milestone:0.4.1:: A month
or so after 0.4.0 with fixes and updates milestone:0.4.2:: Next major
release which improves scripting and simplifies monitoring as well as
updates the Windows Subsystem making NSClient++ much better to monitor
modern windows. milestone:0.4.3:: Maintenance release for 0.4.2 (again a
month or so behind with fixes and updates). milestone:future::
