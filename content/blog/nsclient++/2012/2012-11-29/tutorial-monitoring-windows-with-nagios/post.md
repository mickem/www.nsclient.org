Just found a tutorial by Henri Siponen about getting NSClient++ up and
running with Nagios I figured I would share with everyone. ''Windows
monitoring was fairly simple to set up but I did run into some small
issues. All the guides and tutorials that I found were so outdated that
they werenâ€™t really much of a help. This guide is for the latest Nagios
and nsclient versions (at least for now). Puppet module for the NSClient
at the end of this post.'' ''Though a word of caution:'' I would not
really advocate people to use check\_nt. You will get a lot more mileage
from NSClient++ using other protocols (such as NRPE, NSCA, NRDP or some
such). Still it is great new (modern) tutorial written with the focus of
a beginner in mind! You can find the entire tutorial here:
