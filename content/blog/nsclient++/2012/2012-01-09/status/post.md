Well, I sort of promised to release rc1 of 0.4.0 on which has now become
last year. This was in fact almost about to happen but unfortunately I
grew ill shortly after xmas (nothing serious really). But this has keep
me away from the computer for about 2 weeks now meaning I am slightly
behind. And what is worse I missed the golden "holiday opportunity" to
do some serious documentation. Now it is not too bad I finished the NRPE
unit test last night and hopefully I will get some spare time during
night this week to document the initial usage of 0.4.0 so with luck next
week we will in fact see the first RC of 0.4.0! // Michael Medin
