Hello! First attempt at some documentation is up for 0.4.x. The
documentation will initially be at the wiki somewhere through out summer
I will also start generating non wiki documentation for "old versions"
(0.3.9 will never get one but hence forth the wiki will reflect latest
version and "future old versions" will be archived as static HTML and
PDF. The first version of the documentation is the module pages ie.
plugin and features configuration as well as a list of commands. This is
a bit broken currently and will be improved over summer but please feel
free to come with feed back. You can find one of the pages here:
\[\[CheckEventLog\]\] but all modules has a similar page. // Michael
