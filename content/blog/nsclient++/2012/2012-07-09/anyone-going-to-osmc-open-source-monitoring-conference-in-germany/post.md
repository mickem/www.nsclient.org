Hello I will (contrary to popular rumors) actually be attending and
presenting this year again. And I posted a while back on my blog asking
for ideas on what to speak about you can find it here
\[\[http://blog.medin.name/2012/06/14/what-would-you-like-to-hear-about/\]\].
Then a thought struck me, is there anyone interested in a tutorial
session about using NSClient++ 0.4.x in workshop format? Ie. me showing
how to do stuff starting from scratch and telling you how/when/what/why
and so on and so forth (with you guys listening in). If you are
interested feel free to let me (and/or netways) know and I shall talk to
the netways people and see if something can be arranged. Since I guess
this would fall outside of the normal schedule I guess it could be
either day or evening after/before or some such... just an idea really
so nothing concrete at all at this time... so feel free to let me know
what you think (even if you think it is a terrible idea)... // Michael
