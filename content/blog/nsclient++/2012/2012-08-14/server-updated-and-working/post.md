Well, first off: '''a big thanks''' to all who reported issues and
problems with the server after the upgrade! Now I think everything is
back as it was and hopefully it will be smooth sailing from now on. So
please let me know any issues you discover so I can resolve them. I also
took the opportunity to delete all users which had invalid email
addresses and/or inactivated accounts. Hopefully this (some 200.000
users) was spam bots but given the extensive number of accounts it is
kind of difficult to go through them all so I simply did a big '''DELETE
FROM...''' so '''please forgive me if I accidentally deleted your
account''' and let me (or sign up again) so I can re-instate it. //
