Author: mickem

I wrote a tutorial on using the new real-time monitoring facilities in
NSClient++ on my blog. ''Time for yet another tutorial this time
detailing how to monitoring log files both event log and regular text
files. The event log parts will build a bit on the earlier posts on
monitoring the event log but since the “event log cache” feature has
been replaced by the generic SimpleCache in 0.4.1 as well as 0.4.1
introducing a new SimpleFileWriter module as well I felt it was time to
re-visit this topic.'' You can find it here:
