Hello, I have updated most questions and what not which has dropped in
during summer so if I have missed your question please post a follow up
so I can see what I have missed and I will get back ASAP. One of the big
reasons for the inactivity and the delay is that I got a baby girl last
week so things have been rather hectic leading up to (and since).
Another reason is that I have migrated my VPS to another host which
means installing mail and what not all over again... And yet another
reason is the warm weather and nice summer which sometimes keeps me from
spending time in front of my computer :P // Michael Medin
