Hello, Since the \[http://bambuser.com/v/179087 presentation\] I did on
Noric Meet on Nagios is on bambuser I figured I would share the link to
it so you might all enjoy :) Topics are: \* Basic Usage of NSClient++ \*
Basic Monitoring features \* Eventlog monitoring \* WMI \* Scripting
(very briefly) For the presentation go \[http://bambuser.com/v/179087
here\]. I also held a workshop on scripting on the "windows side" which
unfortunately was not filmed. But I shall add the slides and material to
the wiki this weekend. // Michael Medin
