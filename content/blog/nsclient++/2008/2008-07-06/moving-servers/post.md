Site will be read-only until the move to a new server is complete please
bear with me I hope performance will be better at the new home. I Am
currently using ByteMark but feel the performance to be pretty bad so I
shall move over to SliceHost and see if things improve my tests show
SliceHost to be lightning fast in comparison. Data was just migrated to
the new host and domain transfers are i progress so let me know any
problems you have: michael@medin.name. This is the "new" host so
everything "should" be fine here... // Michael Medin
