as always... sorry for the lack of updates but things are moving
forwards albeit a tad slow. Main reasons beein 1. refacttoring the
settings system takes a while (it is a lot of new code to write) 2. work
is a bitch at the moment. And no, I actually dont do this at work, so
work usually comes first :) 3. New hosting provider. I will soon move
things over to slicehost so hopeefully the speed will improve. I will
also then add so you can register users and such on the trac site. 4.
Forms of Hands :) For those not well wersed in the noise subgenre of
electronic music it is a really nice festival in gladbeck germany that i
usually attend. Right now I am sitting at the, always excelent, Station
hostel in cologne (KÃ¸ln) posting this on my nokia n810 having a cold one
:) Hopefully the new settings subsystem will be functional in a week or
so and after that we will se some new features I hope :) // MickeM
