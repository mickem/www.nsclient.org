Hello, A new version is about to be released I would say next week
(unless something happens) so I will start out:ing RC,:s during the
weekend. The latest nightly build
(NSClient++-Win32-20080905-0714.zip/.msi) is pretty stable. It has been
tested on NT 4.0 (SPx), w2k, XP as well as Vista. It has a few major
improvements and a lot of fixes. The highlights are: \* New reworked
SystemTray that works on Vista and "beyond". \* Improved exception/error
handling. "out-of-the-box" the new SystemTray is disabled and you can
enable it via the "shared\_session=1" option under \[settings\] in
nsc.ini. Be warned that the "new" SystemTray will remain in beta through
out the next version so only enable it if you are comfortable with the
risk of running beta software. :) If the option is "off" (default) it
should not have any major impact. So try it out, let me know how it
works out and hopefully by the end of next week there will be an Ã¼ber
stable 0.3.4 version :) // Michael Medin
