Title: New server, new domain, new upload for sourceforge new....

The server move (I hope) has been smooth and everything is working (I
think). Also all the new domain are "officially" in service so point
your browser to http://nsclient.org instead of the old slightly
offensive nakednuns address :) Hopefully the new host will be faster and
perform better also the new installation has some minor tweaks. For
instance you can now register for an account and thus get email
notifications without leaving your wamil address on the Internet. I have
also uploaded new binaries to source forge and redirected the download
files to the new host (forgot that last time). Please report any
problems you have as I will close down the track on the old "host" (with
a redirect) tomorrow. // Michael Medin
