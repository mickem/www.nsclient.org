Greetings everyone... just popped in quickly to let you know that the
SysTray issue might soon be resolved. I yesterday just before going to
bed managed to get my all-new IPC framework up-and-running so hopefully
in a week or so we will have a beta that once and for all fixes the
System tray issues! Also in other news I just saw that I had managed to
check all my changes into the old "server" so the source repository is
not up-to-date at the moment (I will try to fix in the next few days) //
