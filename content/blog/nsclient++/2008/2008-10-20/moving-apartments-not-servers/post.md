Hello everyone. Since I assume I have a lot of readers on this "blog" I
figured you were all worried thinking I might have died so I better post
a status update. '''NO''' I am not dead! Anyways, I got fed up with my
old apartment when I had the third (if you remember) water leak earlier
this summer. So I ended up in the exchange queue for a new apartment at
my land lord and got an offer for a new apartment which I accepted.

Then we have this moving thing, I sort of estimated "on the outside" 3-4
days moving, one day packing, one day moving and one day unpacking. And
boy do I feel stupid 2 weeks later when I just barely have unpacked my
things. I shall never move again!!! But, apart from a few down-side, I
kind of like the new apartment. The neighbors are actually nice, the
water is actually warm, there is almost space enough for my stuff
(pretty impressive that I managed to "fill" the new apartment since I
just moved from 26m\^2 to 75m\^2 :) Anyways, The major drawback is that
the trains run 24x7 outside my window :( And finally now I only need to
save up so I can actually buy furniture, it is amazing how expensive
IKEA is :) Anyways, the point of all this was to say: Sorry for not
responding for 2 weeks, but now I am back again! // MickeM
