The first nightly build of 0.4.0 has now been uploaded! I wont spend to
much time writing how to use it and so on here as I plan to write up a
guide about that. It is "functionally equivalent" (superior) of the
0.3.x branch but I have yet to merge back the latest changes for 0.3.9
so it is slightly behind there. Usage is best describe by the

    nscp --help

command and the more detailed

    nscp --settings-help

and so on and so forth. I will update the usage guide with details later
on. Using the old configuration should work I think in most cases just
"as-is" but there are always snags and bugs and such. // Michael Medin
