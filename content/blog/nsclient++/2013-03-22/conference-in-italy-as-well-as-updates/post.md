Hello, I guess the biggest news is that I will once again be attending
the '''Open Source System Management Conference 2013''' in Bolzano
Italy. So if your near Italy please come by (it is free) and feel free
to bump in to me if you have any thoughts, ideas or questions. You can
find more information here
\[\[http://www.wuerth-phoenix.com/de/loesungen/system-management/nagios-event/die-ausgabe-2013/\]\].
And please note that even though the page is in German '''the
conference''' it self is '''translated''' into '''German, Italian and
English''' meaning it is open to most people in the region. Also I am
now officially '''back from my vacation''' and have hopefully responded
to most questions from when I was gone '''if I have''' accidentally
'''missed your question''' please don't hesitate to '''bump it to the
top''' and I shall answer ASAP! I will hopefully in the next few weeks
have some news on the up-coming 0.4.2 version which will be the net
major version of NSClient++. // Michael Medin
