I know, a lot of "ticket spam" and whats worse is it is
ticket-change-spam so I cant even delete the ticket. I shall make some
kind of ticket revision delete thingy and try to see if there are any
decent way to deal with spam in trac (seems the spam protection is
pretty crappy). Just give me a few days, just got back from
\[\[http://www.maschinenfest.de/ Maschinenfest\]\] so have not had time
to get things sorted yet :( And BTW, m-fest was bl\*dy awesome! :) //
