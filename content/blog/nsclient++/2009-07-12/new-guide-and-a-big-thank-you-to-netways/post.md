Hello everyone. I have some really nice news and lets get started by a
big big thank you to the guys over at \[http://netways.de netways\] in
Germany for hosting the site. It is an amazing performance improvement!
Secondly to start off the summer I have written a guide on how to use
NSClient++ with Nagios (NSClient, NRPE and NSCA) it is brand new and
feedback is appreciated! The \[wiki:doc/usage/nagios guide can be found
on the wiki\] as well as a PDF (attached below). The idea is to
distribute the PDF with the installation package as the first step in
improving the documentation of NSClient++. Next up is 0.3.7 build which
will fix a few issues and (if I have time) add some new stuff. I shall
also go over the wiki and try to update the documentation but it is
lengthy and (perhaps more so) boring work. As always if anyone wants to
donate to the project and help keep up my documentation spirit feel free
to visit the donation page and become a "fan" of NSClient++.
\[wiki:donate Donations are always welcome!\]. And finally another big
shout out to the guy at netways!
