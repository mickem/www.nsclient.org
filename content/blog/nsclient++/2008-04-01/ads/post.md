Title: Ads?

I hope no one finds this too offensive but I added google ads as an
experiment, more to see if it generates any revenue then to get money
from it. I will let it run for a few weeks and then evaluate the result.
If anyone thinks it is a bad idea drop me a line and I shall think it
over again, as I said it is more of an experiment then anything else. As
for status updates I am working on a checkScheduledTasks module (out in
beta soon I think) tried to make it as a Lua script first but Lua and
COM did not like each other much :( I shall see about that would be nice
to have proper COM support for the Lua module though. // Michael Medin
