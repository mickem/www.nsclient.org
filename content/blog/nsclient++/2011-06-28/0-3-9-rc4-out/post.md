Title: 0.3.9 rc4 out!
Author: mickem
Status: published

Minor update which fixes and improves the where parser. I still need to
verify the file filter which some reports as not working with dates then
I can release the next version (it is a bit slow going as we have summer
and all that now :)...

     2011-06-27 MickeM * Fixed issue where parsers and () which was broken * Made most keywords in the where parser case insensitive so NOT and not as well as AND and AnD should now all work * Changed so unredable processes are debug messages (as modern windows usualy always has a few)
