Title: New Nightly: 64bit

Just a test build cross compiled 64 bit version, let me know if it is a
64 bit program, and what works and what not. Since I (as I have pointed
out before) don't have a 64 bit box I cant really support development
but feel free to let me know if it work, some times you are lucky :) It
lacks regexp (boost did not seem to have any 64-bit option) as well as
some module (check whats there) Again I cannot stress this enough I
don't have a 64 bit reg to try anything on so this is a blind compile!
Don't expect things to work and ABSOLUTLY DON NOT roll this out to all
your 64 bit boxes (it wont work). But it is something... Ohh, and look
under download fore the x64 nightly (the w32 ones will hence forth be
called Win32). // MickeM
