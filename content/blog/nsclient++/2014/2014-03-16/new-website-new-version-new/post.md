Greetings all!

New big tidings. Not just the long overdue release of 0.4.2 but also a
brand new web site.

I have been planning a new website for some time but haven't gotten
around to it until now. Hopefully the new site will be a bit simpler to
navigate and more importantly simpler for me to communicate with you.
The focus now have been on creating a base site which has the
information part of NSClient++ and put all the documentation in the
documentation site. In the near future I will migrate the forum over to
a WordPress version and see what to do about the tickets. They might go
to github or something along those lines. But that has yet to be
decided.
