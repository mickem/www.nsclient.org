Title: Switch to GIT (from subversion)

I finally decided (as I need to start working on multiple versions) to
switch to git as it has a slightly better workflow for that. This means
in addition to browsing the source here locally you can now also enjoy
the source over at: \[https://github.com/mickem/nscp GitHub\] and
\[https://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=git&group\_id=131326 SourceForge\].
I don't really plan to host a public repository on nsclient.org as
GitHub and SourceForge will have the same code. // Michael Medin
