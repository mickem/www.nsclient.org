Author: mickem
Tags: 0.4.0, doc, documentation, release-candidate
Status: published

I have started to write documentation for the 0.4.x version. Currently
we have the following documents: \[\[wiki:doc/installation/0.4.x\]\]
\[\[wiki:doc/configuration/0.4.x\]\] \[\[wiki:doc/usage/0.4.x\]\]
\[\[wiki:doc/usage/0.4.x/client\]\]
\[\[wiki:doc/usage/0.4.x/settings\]\]
\[\[wiki:doc/usage/0.4.x/service\]\] \[\[wiki:doc/usage/0.4.x/test\]\]
Next up is a migration guide as well as a concept document. RC1 is still
scheduled for this weekend so please help out next week to do some
testing! Note that all documents are "first draft" so it is a bit all
over the place currently :P // Michael Medin
