Just wanted to thank OP5 for arranging and inviting me to Nagios Nordic
Meet (http://www.nagiosnordicmeet.wmr.se/). A really amazing event with
a lot of interesting speakers as well as a lot very very of nice
participants from around the world. It was really overwhelming to see
that there are so many users of NSClient++ out there and a big extra
thank you to all of you! I would also take the opportunity to thank
everyone who I bumped into and came with nice feedback and ideas for
NSClient++. I shall post a few snapshots from the event when I am at
home again (tomorrow) and also try to summarize some of the ideas that
you might expect in NSClient++ in the future. // MickeM
