Title: Documentation!

Well, I have spent a few days now working on converting parts of the
wiki documentation to rst and now I will publish the first version of
the documentation http://docs.nsclient.org/ Please understand that this
is the first version so many pages are still missing and some parts of
it are not formatted properly and the index is rubbish. But I figured I
would get some feedback from the community in the mean time. Also note
that while this documentation is the for the up-coming 0.4.2 much is
still valid and relevant for the current stable 0.4.1 as well so please
spend some time to brows through it and let me know what you think!
