Author: mickem
Status: published

Started to rework the WMI plugin (much better now I hope) also have a
few more thing splanned in that regard so stay tuned. Also some other
minor fixes here and there so try it out and let me know how things do.
Will start to wrap up when I get the WMI function all together and then
we will have 0.2.8
