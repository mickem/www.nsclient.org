Title: 0.3.0 Released!
Author: mickem
Status: published

Finally, after much strife and hardship, the new version seems to be
stable (or possibly all my wondrous beta testers (yes... I mean you,
there can be only one) have just been lazy and not reported all the bugs
they found in the RC :) Anyways, for those will on 0.2.7 there is a lot
of new features and I think a lot of stability improvements. For those
on the bleeding edge there is nothing new (a few bugs fixed since RC1 is
all). The main new features in the 0.3.x line is: \* Improved WMI module
\* Unicode support (that means people in <insert country far away here>
can use performance counters. \* \*FIXES\* in the socket handling
(hopefully it actually works now) \* Some new performance counters as
well as slightly better handling Hopefully things are working, if not
let me know, I shall wait till tomorrow before posting to sourceforge so
feel free to let me know any bugs before then so I can quick-fix them :)
