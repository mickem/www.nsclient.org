Yaay! Finally cleaned up and classified all tickets. This means you can
now get an idea about when something will be fixed. Issues I think are
mainly bugfixes and/or small changes have been set to 0.4.0 but I cannot
guarantee that they will all be included. I will fr RC3 out in a week or
soo) have a defined scope and after that everything not fixed will be
retargeted to 0.4.1. Please note that if your "issue" is NOT included in
0.4.0 milestone PLEASE let me know now if you feel it would be important
as now itÂ´s the time to make changes to it. // Michael Medin
