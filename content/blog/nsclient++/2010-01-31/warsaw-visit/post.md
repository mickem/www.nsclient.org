Hello, I thought Id quickly post here that I will be in Warsaw (course
about coherence) so probably wont be much updates this week. If anyone
has any sightseeing ideas or wanna grab a beer or something like that
drop me an email at michael at medin dot name. As for the client there
is a new nightly build out a few days ago with some fixes and such. I am
currently reworking some stuff in the 0.4.x brance wich I hope to have a
beta for in the next few weeks. // Michael Medin
