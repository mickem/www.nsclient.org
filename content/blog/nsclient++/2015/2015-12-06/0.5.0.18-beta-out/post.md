Title: New beta build 0.5.0.18 is out!
Authors: Michael Medin
Tags: nightly,nsclient++,0.5.0
Status: published

This is a minor update with some bug-fixes. I mainly built this as I wanted to generate new documentation.
If you want to take it for a spin you can visit the download page [here](/download/0.5.0/).

In other news I have also added back the archives so you can download old versions of NSClient++ again if you want (look under download above).
