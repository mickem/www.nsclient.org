Seems the new fantastic forums are not so fantastic or maybe I was not
so fantastic in setting them up. Seems the discourse update
was botched which was solved with some manual bundle install

Long story short: **they are up again**.

Since I am behind a nasty firewall and don't have my laptop handy I cant
really do anything to diagnose the issue until I get tonight (CET).

So I will hopefully get things up an running in a few hours, sorry for
the inconvenience...

UPDATED:

Change text to reflect that forums are back up...
