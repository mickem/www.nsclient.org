Hello, Sorry for being "away" but I went on vacation and discovered that
the fabulous Internet I used last year was "over sold" so it was
impossible to use. Right now I have, to recoup, set my Firefox to
auto-browse random pages so hopefully I shall be normal again in a bit,
two weeks without Internet is a harsh punishment :) Anyways, since you
have all been working greatly I shall go over the back log and post
replies in the next few days, need to do some laundrey and what not as
well so might take a day or two... // Michael Medin
