Well, seems the upgrade went smoothly. a few snags though and with
trac-hacks is down I cant fetch the missing plugins. I will try to fix
this later today so please bear with me. I guess the most prominent
feature missing is "tracnav" which is missing causing the "menu" to go
away making it very difficult to browse the wiki. I will also try to
update and upgrade some plugins later this evening... // Michael Medin
