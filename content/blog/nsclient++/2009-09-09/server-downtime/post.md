Hello, Sorry everyone for the downtime but apparently a hardware failure
occurred, everything is back up and running now again and I think given
the situation this spring it is a huge improvement! Especially since
this is the first downtime in months! There will be a planned downtime
tomorrow again for about 30 minutes when they will move the guest to a
new host (now it is on a temporary one). // Michael Medin
