Hello everyone... I started to write a guide about migrating to 0.4.1
(from 0.3.x) so if you are upgrading please read through that first to
give some understanding and insight into what has changed and how it
affects you as well as some info on whats to come soon. As always please
feel free to comment and let me know what is needed. I hope to
add/update it a bit more during the week end. \[wiki:doc/migrate/0.4.1\]
