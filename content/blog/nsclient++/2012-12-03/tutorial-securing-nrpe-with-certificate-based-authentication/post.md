I wrote a tutorial on the new certificate handling in 0.4.1 and how to
setup various forms of certificate based authentication. ''NRPE is a
common easy to use option for monitoring remote machines from Nagios or
Icinga. Unfortunately NRPE, with out of the box setup, is not what I
would consider secure. This tutorial looks at how you can secure your
NRPE traffic by using NSClient++ both as a client and server (yes it
runs on Linux as well) in conjunction with SSL certificates to provide
certificate based authentication.'' You can find the full post here:
