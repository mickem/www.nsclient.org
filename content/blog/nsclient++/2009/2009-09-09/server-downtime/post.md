Hello, Sorry everyone for the downtime but apparently a hardware failure
occurred, everything is back up and running now again and I think given
the situation this spring it is a huge improvement! Especially since
this is the first downtime in months! '''UPDATE''' No planned downtime
tomorrow! Just got a quick shout from Bernt Erk at netways that they
wont have to move the host tomorrow so no planned downtime for tomorrow.
So once again a big thank you to the people at \[http://netways.de
netways\] awesome hosting! // Michael Medin
