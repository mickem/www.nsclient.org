Sight... Apparently (I just discovered) trac 11 was a '''big''' mistake
memory usage has gone through the roof as well as overall performance. I
shall investigate if I can downgrade again this weekend or possibly
dist-upgrade and see if python 2.5 is better then 2.4 (apparently it is
somewhat better on memory usage). But for the moment you will have to
live with a reealy slow site! // MickeM
