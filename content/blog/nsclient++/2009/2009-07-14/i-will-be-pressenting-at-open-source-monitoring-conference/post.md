Netways will be holding an Open Source Monitoring Conference with a
strong focus on Nagios again this year. I shall (again) be speaking and
this year. Last year I did a presentation on Windows monitoring and I
will follow up that this year with a workshop. The topic for the
workshop will focus around windows monitoring and we will
install/configure NSClient++ and then setup a series of checks to
monitor your windows environment. In Addition to this I will also give a
presentation on Application Monitoring where I will dive into how to
monitor your Java based middleware via (amongst other things) JMX.
Details on the conference can be found at the web page

free to hit me with questions before and I shall try to incorporate the
answers in my presentation. Also if you attended last year feel free to
provide me with some feedback so I might improve this years
presentation! // Michael Medin
