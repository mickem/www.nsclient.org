New nightly build out. Mainly this has a much improved installer so
please let me know how it work out. Also if you have an old version of
NSCLient++ (which is not upgraded/uninstalled propperly) send mt the
install log (msiexec /l\* log.txt /i <msi>) so I can add it to the
"uniinstall thingy" I have added. There is also some fixes in the
CheckFile department which fixes a few issues here and there. // Michael
