Title: 0.4.x status updates

Yesterday I switched one of my machines to use the 0.4.x version at
home. And everything (read the basic things I had on that machine) seems
to just work out of the box using the "old" configuration file. So
hopefully things will start coming together soon. Just to recap the main
"problem" for people upgrading will be people using NSCA since that has
changed a lot. But the good part of this news is that 0.4.x is now fully
functional (apart from performance data). So after some installer twekas
I can start build nightly builds... // Michael Medin
