Title: More spam filtering

After looking for a few days now and not finding any way to add spam
filtering to the trac discussion plugin I wrote on myself. SO hopefully
there shall be less forum spam now. It is a bit of a hack since I don't
know much about python nor trac development but it seems to work but if
you have any problems let me know. It works much like all the other
"normal" spam filtering i.e. it is a simple adapter between them so it
has all the usual features like akismet and such. I was a bit impressed
by how easy it was to implement it so cudos to the trac team for making
trac such a nice modularized system :) // MickeM
