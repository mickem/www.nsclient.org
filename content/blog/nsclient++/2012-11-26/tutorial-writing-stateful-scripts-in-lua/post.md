I wrote a tutorial on how to write statefull scripts in Lua on my blog.
''Stateful scripts are a simple yet powerfully way to enhance your
monitoring which I think is used far to little. Using stateful script
you can easily add simple predictions and change management. This is
very easy to accomplished using NSClient++ as its built-in scripting
modules by default provides stateful scripts (in contrast to Nagios and
Icinga which tends to be stateless). This tutorial will walk you through
writing a simple stateful script in Lua. If you are still confused about
stateful scripts the main benefit is that they remember things. Thus you
can alert when something changes as well as predict the future. A good
example of this is disk growth prediction but there are a lot of other
scenarios where they are useful.'' You can find it here:
